    <h1>My Neighborhood</h1>
    <p>I currently live in Addison, TX. It's a relatively small city in Dallas just North of Interstate-635. Addison has residental neighborhoods as well as commercial spots. Some of the biggest tech companies are located in Addison like Bottle Rocket Apps and Nerium.</p>

    <h3>Restaurants</h3>
    <p>With around 15,000 residents and nearly 200 restaurants, Addison has the most restaurants per capita than any city in the US. Some of my favorite places to eat are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sherlockspub.com/">Sherlock's Baker St. Pub and Grill</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://vidorrarestaurants.com/">Vidorra</a></li>
